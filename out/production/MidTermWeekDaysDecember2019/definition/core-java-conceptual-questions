What is difference between path and classpath variables?

classpath is an environment variable which is used by the java compiler to find the path of classes.


What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?

Abstract class may declare funtionality that subclasses can implement or override. Interface states functionality but
cannot implement it.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
we can not make an object from abstract and interface class since they are incomplete class. We can implement a subclass
of them.

what is Access Specifier?
it contorl the access to classes, mehtods and ohter memebrs.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.

Object oriented Programming. The feartures are
Encapsulation: the variable of a class will be hidden from other class and only be accessed using the methods of their
current class.
Abstraction: hiding peripheral details and showing relevant details thorough abstract class and interface.
polymorphism: ability of an object, variable or funciton to take on multiple forms.
Inheritence: one object acquires the properties and behaivor of parent object.

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
a package is a colleciton of related classes. default package is java.lang.package

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
java supports multiple inhertance thourgh interfaces but not thorugh classes. Because it leads to overridding of methods
when both extended class have same method name.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
A class may have more than one method with the same method name, however, arguments pass through them are different.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.

perform clean up processing jsut before object is garbage collected.
What is a constructor ?
A constructor is a special method used to initialize a newly created object and having teh same name of a class.

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?

A Class can have multiple constructor as long as thier signature or parameters are different.

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
A default contrucotr with no arguments will be called.

How java manage it's memory?
garbage collector.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?

with another. it will throw java.lang.ClasscastException.

What is Singleton class?
It is a class that can have only one object (an instance of class) at a time.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
Serialization converts the state of an object into bytestream. and deserialization reverse convert the bytestream into
object instance.

when to use transient variable in java?
Serialization process should ignore transient variables while creating a bytestream of that class.

Difference between while and do..while loop?
in while loop, condition is tested at the begining of the loop and in do while loop, condition is tested at teh end.

teh garbage collector will automatically colllect when it needs to. With JVM, data is stored in Heap which is a shared
region of memory that all JVM thread can access.

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
stack memory is used to store local variables and function call while heap memory is used to store objects in java.

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
